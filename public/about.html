<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm passionate about a variety of interests and always eager to learn and explore new things. My interests span 
  from technology to sports, with a keen focus on building custom gaming PCs and staying up-to-date with the latest in 
  computer hardware. With a budget of Rs. 60000 in 2024, I enjoy curating the best components for a powerful and future-proof 
  gaming setup.</p>

<p>I am also an avid fan of fantasy cricket, constantly on the lookout for the best team suggestions for specific 
  matches to stay ahead in the game. When I'm not immersed in technology or fantasy sports, you can find me on the 
  soccer field, playing both right back and right wing positions, combining my love for the sport with an active 
  lifestyle.</p>

<p>Fitness is another significant aspect of my life. I have a special interest in running, particularly in 
  finding the best running shoes for flat feet within a budget of Rs. 3000. To complement my physical activities, 
  I am embarking on a beginner calisthenics routine, which I follow from Monday to Sunday, with dedicated rest days to ensure 
  balanced progress.</p>

<p>Through my diverse interests and pursuits, I strive to maintain a well-rounded and fulfilling life, always seeking 
  to improve and enjoy the journey along the way.</p>
